# Ruby Calculator

* Attempting to create a simple four or five function calculator in Ruby.  Originally did something like this in college written in C.  That's where the idea came from.
* Initially checked in the code.  Needs a lot of rework.

## To Do
- [ ] Can I, or should I, separate this into classes and modules?
- [ ] DRY, there's a lot of repeated code, e.g. 
```ruby
gets.chomp.to_i
```
See about defining it in a module and then call it
- [ ] Refactor so the output repeats the expression and displays the answer
- [ ] Refactor to work with more than two numbers
  - [ ] Etc.
