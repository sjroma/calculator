# Calculator

* Attempting to create a simple four or five function calculator in Ruby.  Originally did something like this in college
written in C.  That's where the idea came from.
* Initially checked in the code.  Needs a lot of rework.

## Task list
- [] Can I, or should I, separate this into classes and modules?
- [] There's a lot of repeated code, e.g. 
```ruby
gets.chomp.to_i
```
See about defining it in a module and then call it
- [] Can I make it so the output repeats the expression and displays the answer?
- [] What if I want to work with more than two numbers?
